Database : 

Meta Data : a description of whats stored in the Stored Databse


Why do we need Database systems instead of files? 
- it would be hard to find and work with a specific file 
- if you need to change something in the system then you will have to change the file a little bit you would havee to go back to the code written for it and change that as well 
- there is no standardization : everytime you have to change something you have to modify the code and it would be hard to merge the data with another system
- security 
	- who can access the file :: anyone who has access to the drive 
	- you can not modify what is shown when someone opens the file 
		- ex. you dont want everyone to see SSN's of students so that would need to be hidden 
- no system to tell you if there are data incosistencies if using a notepad file


Atomicity - you either do it all or you dont do it at all: if something happens with the transaction then it rolls back (how to make it run concurently)

A data table can also be called a relational model 
-  the first row is the attribute names 
- the columns are called attributes 
- the rows it called a record



- Every record can have a different number of attributes
- 



Data Abstraction
- Physical level
